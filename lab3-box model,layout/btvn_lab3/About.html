        <p class="text-padding10">
          Jiu-Jitsu, or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as it is commonly named outside
          Brazil, is a grappling orientated martial art/combat sport that
          evolved from its Japanese roots in 1920s Brazil, and continued to
          evolve for many decades after until its present format. This style
          though previously established in its native country became highly
          popular in the northern hemisphere after a series of cage-fighting
          performances from BJJ representative Royce Gracie in the early UFC’s
          (Ultimate Fighting Championship) where he battled against competitors
          from many different martial arts backgrounds in the no holds barred
          tournament, becoming the fighting promotion’s first champion. This
          event proved Jiu Jitsu’s efficiency and helped raise awareness to this
          combat form all around the world, becoming one of the reasons behind
          the sport’s growth.

        <p class="text-padding10">
          The history of Jiu-Jitsu in Brazil is not a settled or linear event
          and it has many forms and theories. One thing does seem to generate
          some consensus. The fact that one man had a strong influence in the
          sport’s inception, Mitsuyo Maeda – known in Brazil as Conde Coma
          (Count Coma). Maeda was a student of Jigoro Kano and his Kodokan
          School of martial arts. Though Kano is widely recognized as the father
          of Judo, his style of teaching was regarded in the early days as a
          branch of Ju-Jitsu and not it’s own martial style. In fact, Jigoro’s
          branch of Ju-Jitsu has been diluted from its original format over the
          years by consistent changes to Judo’s rules and regulations. Mitsuyo
          Maeda was one of Jigoto Kano’s star pupils and traveled the world as a
          prize-fighter during the early stages of the 20th century. Maeda
          traveled all over the globe displaying the art in arenas and circuses,
          passing through the United States, England, and many other countries
          before landing in Brazil. It is here that the story gets murky.
          According to the Gracie family, Maeda met Carlos Gracie when he was a
          young boy, a troubled teenager that Maeda took under his wing and
          taught the Kano style. Gracie would then pass the knowledge down to
          his brothers who were groundbreaking in innovating and representing
          this fighting style in Rio de Janeiro and later the world. This
          narrative has been debunked by different martial arts historians,
          namely Roberto Pereira and Robert Drysdale who claim Carlos never met
          Maeda and that, instead, Gracie likely learned how to grapple from
          another student of Mitsuyo. Outside of Maeda’s lineage tree, there
          were other Japanese masters teaching in Brazil at the same time, men
          who were lesser-known, though still relevant to the development of
          Brazilian grappling, people like Takeo Iano in the North of Brazil and
          Kazuo Yoshida in Bahia, to name a few
