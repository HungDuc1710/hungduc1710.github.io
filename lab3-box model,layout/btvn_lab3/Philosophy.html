          The practice of Jiu-Jitsu goes beyond the execution of throws, chokes,
          immobilisations, strikes, and joint locks. A true appreciation and
          understanding of the Jiu-Jitsu philosophy prepares you for life. It
          guides you to a healthier lifestyle and the most efficient use of
          mental, physical, and spiritual strength. Beyond the mat, Gracie
          family members live balanced, healthy lives based on the philosophy of
          their gentle art. Jiu-Jitsu is more than hobby, more than a martial
          art -. it’s a way of life. Looking after your body is Jiu-Jitsu,
          eating well is Jiu-Jitsu, looking after your community is Jiu-Jitsu.
          Grand Masters Carlos and Helio Gracie believed that the principles of
          patience, efficiency, and control were vital to succeed in any aspect
          of life. They lived according to these principles for almost a
          century. The philosophy of Jiu-Jitsu defines the state of mind that a
          warrior should adopt in combat to enable victory; it is a philosophy
          of yielding to an opponent’s force, instead of trying to oppose force
          with force. Ultimately, the fundamentals for good Jiu-Jitsu are also
          the fundamentals of good character. The Gracie Triangle, the widely
          recognized symbol of the Gracie Academy, and has evolved over the
          years. You will see it on the front of every academy or martial arts
          school dedicated to teaching the philosophy and techniques of Gracie
          Jiu-Jitsu. The triangle represents a stable base regardless of
          position, it always has a strong base. The three sides of the triangle
          represent the three components of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu mastery : mind,
          body, and spirit. The slight indent close to the top of the triangle
          forms the letter “G” for Gracie. The two fighters inside represent all
          those who practice Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and seek to master their mind,
          body, and spirit in Jiu-Jitsu and in life.
